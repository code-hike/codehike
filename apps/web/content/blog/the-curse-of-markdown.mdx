Markdown is so good that it can hurt you.

chapters:

- introducing richness vs ax
- pre-markdown tradeoffs
- enter markdown
- the tradeoff wall
- enter mdx
- enter rsc
- the content presentation gap
- enter code hike

Tradeoffs: https://youtu.be/zqhE-CepH2g?si=7iYgDUjAhJNVmYJN&t=446

- technical cost vs product benefit

examples of websites that mdx allow:

- josh's blog
- react docs

---

it doesnt mean that there aren't websites in this zone. but they pay a high price, either because they have resources to do so, or because they care a lot about the product.

Examples are:

- stripe
- swiftui
- nanda
- pudding
